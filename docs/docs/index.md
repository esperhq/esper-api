Esper API allows a two-way real time communication with the Esper Control Suite. It exposes all the functionality of the Esper Control Suite allowing you to create advanced script-driven routines for scanning.

## Languages
This API wrapper is written for NodeJS using [Socket.IO](http://socket.io) for communication

Socket.IO provides bindings for most programming languages, so while the Esper API wrapper is currently only written in node, it is possible to write your own API wrapper in a language of your choice. See [Advanced Endpoints](advanced.md) for socket.IO endpoint information for creating your own wrapper.


## Installation
Install with [NPM]('http://npmjs.com/esper-api') using `npm install esper-api` 
Source code available on [Github](https://github.com/esperhq/esper-api).


## Usage

Required the Esper Control Suite to be running.
