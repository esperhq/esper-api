Esper API allows a two-way real time communication with the Esper Control Suite. It exposes all the functionality of the Esper Control Suite allowing you to create advanced script-driven routines for scanning.

## Languages
This API wrapper is written for NodeJS using [Socket.IO](http://socket.io) for communication

There are Socket.IO bindings for most programming languages, so while the Esper API wrapper is written in Node.js, it is possible to write your own API wrapper in a language of your choice. See [API in other programming languages](92-usingOtherLanguages.md) for socket.IO endpoint information for creating your own wrapper.


## Installation
Install with [NPM]('http://npmjs.com/esper-api') using `npm install esper-api` 
Source code available on [Github](https://github.com/esperhq/esper-api).


## Usage

Required the Esper Control Suite to be running.
